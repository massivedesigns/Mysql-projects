<img width="1256" alt="banner1" src="https://github.com/massivedesigns/images-in-readme/assets/42479736/ca981244-6b59-4f81-bf5c-88ad93323883">

This repository contains two distinct projects: "EmployeeManagementDB" and "EPLMatchesAnalysis." Each project focuses on different aspects of database management and analysis in SQL.

## EmployeeManagementDB

### Project Overview

The "EmployeeManagementDB" project involves the creation and management of a comprehensive employee database. It includes the creation of two key tables, `EmployeeDemographics` and `EmployeeSalary`, along with various SQL queries to showcase different concepts such as SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, PARTITION BY, CTE, Temp Tables, String Functions, Stored Procedures, and Subqueries.

### SQL Script Contents

The SQL script in this project covers the following:

- Table creation and data insertion for employee demographics and salary information.
- Usage of CASE statements for conditional logic in SQL.
- Introduction to HAVING clause for filtering results based on aggregate functions.
- Implementation of temporary tables and common table expressions (CTE).
- String functions usage, including TRIM, LTRIM, RTRIM, REPLACE, SUBSTRING, UPPER, and LOWER.
- Creation and execution of stored procedures for efficient data retrieval.
- Subqueries demonstrated in SELECT, FROM, and WHERE statements.

### Project Name: EmployeeManagementDB

This project aims to provide a solid foundation for employee data management, salary analysis, and insightful queries for decision-making.

## EPLMatchesAnalysis

### Project Overview

The "EPLMatchesAnalysis" project focuses on data cleaning and analysis of English Premier League (EPL) statistics. It includes transforming and optimizing the `eplmatches_stats` table by addressing issues with the date and time columns. The project also involves date and time extraction, updating the table with new columns, and performing a detailed analysis of match data.

### SQL Script Contents

The SQL script in this project covers the following:

- Data cleaning steps for two EPL-related tables (`epl_league_stats` and `eplmatches_stats`).
- Extraction and conversion of date and time information from the `date_GMT` column.
- Updating the table with new columns to store transformed date and time values.
- Detailed analysis of match data, including top matches by attendance and specific match conditions.

### Project Name: EPLMatchesAnalysis

This project aims to enhance the quality of EPL match data and derive meaningful insights for further exploration and visualization.
